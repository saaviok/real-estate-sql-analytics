# 🏢 Real Estate SQL Analytics Project  
**End-to-End Data Analytics | Business Insights | Advanced SQL**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL analytics workflow, from data modeling and quality validation to advanced analytical queries used for business decision-making.

While the domain is real estate, the analytical techniques mirror those used in **AML, Compliance, Risk, and Financial Crime analytics**, including pattern detection, aggregation logic, trend analysis, and exception identification.

The project is designed to reflect how a data analyst actually works in a **regulated, business-driven environment** — not just isolated SQL queries.

---

## 🎯 Business Questions Answered
This project answers practical, stakeholder-driven questions such as:

- How do property prices and price-per-sqft vary across cities and property types?
- Which properties show unusual pricing patterns or outliers?
- How do current values compare to previous sale prices over time?
- Which regions and property categories drive the most revenue?
- How can trends and rankings be identified using window functions?

These questions parallel **risk segmentation, anomaly detection, and performance monitoring** commonly seen in AML and compliance analytics.

## 🧠 Analytical Skills Demonstrated
- Relational data modeling  
- Data quality validation & null analysis  
- Complex joins and subqueries  
- Aggregations & KPI calculations  
- Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, moving averages)  
- Time-based trend analysis  
- Business-focused SQL logic  
- Clean, production-style query organization  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible syntax)
- Analytical SQL patterns used in enterprise analytics teams
- GitHub for version control and portfolio presentation
